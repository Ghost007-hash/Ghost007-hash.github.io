                            <li><strong>Seasonal Demand:</strong> The winter season typically leads to increased consumption of heating oil and energy, driving higher demand for crude oil.</li>
                            <li><strong>OPEC+ Production Cuts:</strong> Key producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia have implemented production cuts to stabilize prices. For instance, Saudi Arabia reduced its output by over 1 million barrels per day in the last quarter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shale Oil Dynamics:</strong> The USA continues to expand shale oil production, partially offsetting supply reductions from traditional oil-exporting countries.</li>

                            <li><strong>USD Exchange Rate:</strong> Brent is priced in USD, so fluctuations in the dollar's value directly affect oil prices. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for other currencies, potentially reducing demand.</li>

                    <li><strong>Market Players:</strong> The USA and Saudi Arabia remain influential in the global oil market due to their production capabilities and export strategies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Geopolitical tensions and economic conditions, such as interest rates and dollar strength, continue to inject volatility into the market.</li>
